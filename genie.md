# Leveraging Databricks AI for Data Analysis & Agentic Frameworks

This document outlines how to use Databricks' AI capabilities, specifically focusing on **Genie**, to accelerate data analysis and build powerful, autonomous agentic frameworks using its API.

First, it's important to understand the distinction between the two main AI components in Databricks:

* **Databricks Assistant**: This is the broad, overarching suite of AI-powered tools. Its features include inline code completion, generating code comments, and providing the conversational chat interface.
* **Databricks Genie**: This is the **conversational, chat-based experience** within the Assistant. You interact with Genie by asking questions in natural language to generate, explain, debug, and visualize code and data.

This guide focuses on **Genie**, as its conversational API is the key to building agentic systems.

## Leveraging Databricks Genie for Advanced Data Analysis

Databricks Genie acts as a powerful conversational partner for data teams, dramatically accelerating workflows by translating natural language into executable assets.

### Key Capabilities

* **Natural Language to Code**
    Genie's core strength is converting plain-language questions into executable code.
    > **Example Prompt:** "What were our top 10 best-selling products by revenue in the last quarter?"
    Genie will generate the precise SQL query to answer this, democratizing data access for less technical users and saving time for experts.

* **Code Explanation and Debugging**
    Genie can make complex code understandable. Paste a script and ask Genie to "explain what this code does" or "find the error in this query." It provides natural language explanations and suggests fixes, which is invaluable for code maintenance and team collaboration.

* **Automated Visualization**
    After generating data, you can issue follow-up commands to create visualizations instantly.
    > **Example Prompt:** "Visualize these results as a bar chart comparing product revenue."
    Genie automatically generates the corresponding charts within the notebook, turning raw data into insights without manual configuration.

## Building an Agentic Framework with the Genie API

An **agentic framework** is a system where an autonomous AI agent can reason, plan, and execute a series of tasks to achieve a high-level goal. The Genie API is perfectly suited to be the "reasoning engine" for such an agent in data-centric workflows.

The agent operates in a continuous loop: **Plan -> Observe -> Act**. The Genie API is the critical component in the **Plan** and **Act** phases, where it generates the code for the agent to execute.

### How It Works

You can build an application using an orchestrator (like a custom Python script or a framework like LangChain) that calls the Genie API to perform multi-step data analysis autonomously.

**Step 1: Define the Agent's Goal**
The process begins with a complex objective.
> **Goal:** "Generate a complete performance report on last month's product launch in the APAC region, including sales trends, customer acquisition, and key city performance."

**Step 2: The Agent Plans and Queries Genie**
The agent's orchestrator breaks the goal into a logical sequence. For the first step, it formulates a precise prompt for the Genie API.

> **Agent's Thought:** "First, I need to get all sales transactions for the new product in the APAC region for the specified month."

The agent sends an API call:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Write a SQL query to get all sales for product ID 'ABC-123' in the APAC region from last month."
}
