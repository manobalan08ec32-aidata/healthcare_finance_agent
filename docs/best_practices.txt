**Best Practices for Quality Prompts**

### Time Periods - Be Specific
- Avoid: "last 6 months", "previous quarter", "recent data"
- Use: "January 2024 to June 2024", "Q1 2024", "2023 vs 2024 comparison"
- Why: The chatbot interprets relative dates from today, not completed periods.

### Keywords - Use Exact Terms
- Avoid: "XYZ carrier", "ABC pharmacy", "that product"
- Use: "Carrier Humana", "LOB C&S", "External pharmacy", "Therapeutic class Diabetes"

### Forecast Scenarios - Be Clear
- Avoid: "forecast data", "projected numbers"
- Use: "8+4 forecast scenario", "2+10 forecast scenario", "BUDGET vs GAAP"

### Data Sources - Be Explicit
- Avoid: "prescription data", "financial data"
- Use: "PBM claims data", "Pharmacy transaction data", "Actuals vs Forecast analysis"

### Business Terms to Use
- Lines of Business: C&S, Medicare, Medicaid
- Pharmacy Types: External, Internal, Retail, Mail order
- Claim Status: Paid, Reversed, Rejected
- Financial Terms: AWP, WAC, COGS, GDR

### Quick Tips
- Break complex queries into focused requests
- Specify output format: "show as table" or "provide summary"
- Use exact field names from datasets
- Mention specific therapeutic classes when relevant
- Always specify which forecast scenario you're comparing

### Common Mistakes
- Using relative time periods without context
- Mixing data sources without clarification
- Using abbreviations without defining them first
- Asking for data across different forecast scenarios without specifying

### Trigger Strategic Analysis
Use these phrases for deeper insights:
- "Strategic analysis of..."
- "Root cause analysis for..."
- "Variance analysis for..."
- "Trend analysis showing..."

These prompts generate comprehensive responses with multiple data views and actionable insights.
