NOW ANALYZE THIS USER INPUT:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
User Input: "new question - what is the revenue for PBM for july 2025"
Previous Question: "None"
Previous Questions History: []
User's Explicit Choice: follow-up

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: INPUT CLASSIFICATION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Classify into ONE type:

**GREETING** - Greetings, capability questions, general chat
Examples: "Hi", "Hello", "What can you do?", "Help me"

**DML/DDL** - Data modification (not supported)
Examples: "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", "CREATE table"

**BUSINESS_QUESTION** - Healthcare finance queries
Valid topics: Claims, pharmacy, drugs, therapy classes, revenue, expenses, payments, utilization, actuals, forecasts
Invalid: Weather, sports, retail, non-healthcare topics

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: COMPONENT DETECTION (For business questions)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Identify components in CURRENT question using these patterns:

**Metric** - What's being measured
Examples: revenue, claims, expenses, volume, actuals, forecast, cost

**Filters** - "for X" pattern → Specific entities/values
Examples:
- "for PBM" → filters: ["PBM"]
- "for Specialty" → filters: ["Specialty"]
- "for diabetes" → filters: ["diabetes"]
- "for carrier MDOVA" → filters: ["carrier MDOVA"]

**Attributes** - "by Y" pattern → Grouping dimensions
Examples:
- "by line of business" → attributes: ["line of business"]
- "by carrier" → attributes: ["carrier"]
- "by therapy class" → attributes: ["therapy class"]

**Time Period**
- Full: "August 2025", "Q3 2025" → time_is_partial: false
- Partial: "August", "Q3" → time_is_partial: true

**Signals**
- Pronouns: "that", "it", "this", "those"
- Continuation: "compare", "show me", "breakdown"
- Explicit commands: "NEW:", "FOLLOW-UP:" at start

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: DECISION LOGIC
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Priority 1: User's Explicit UI Choice (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
User selected: follow-up
IF user_input_type == "new-question" → Decision: NEW (respect user's explicit choice)
IF user_input_type == "follow-up" → Decision: FOLLOW_UP (respect user's explicit choice)

**Priority 2: User Command in Text** (Check second)
IF current starts with "New Question:" → Decision: NEW
IF current starts with "Follow up question:" → Decision: FOLLOW_UP

**Priority 3: Automatic Detection** (Only if no explicit choice above)

1. **Validation keywords** ("validate", "wrong", "fix") → VALIDATION

2. **No previous question** → NEW

3. **Has pronouns** ("that", "it", "this", "those") → FOLLOW-UP

4. **Complete question check:**
   IF current has ALL of: metric + filters + time with year → NEW

   **CRITICAL:** Having attributes alone does NOT make a question complete.
   Filters must be present for a question to be considered complete.

   Examples of COMPLETE (has filters):
   - "revenue for PBM for Q3 2025" → has metric + filters + time → NEW
   - "actuals for PBM for September 2025" → has metric + filters + time → NEW
   - "actuals vs forecast 8+4 for Specialty for Q3 2025" → has metric + filters + time → NEW

   Examples of INCOMPLETE (no filters):
   - "revenue by line of business for 2025" → has metric + attributes + time, but NO filters → FOLLOW-UP
   - "claims by carrier for Q3 2025" → has metric + attributes + time, but NO filters → FOLLOW-UP

   Why FOLLOW-UP? Without filters, the question needs context from previous (which entity/channel to analyze).

5. **Incomplete question check:**
   IF current is MISSING any of: metric, filters, or time → FOLLOW-UP

   Examples of INCOMPLETE:
   - "compare actuals for September" → has metric + time, but MISSING filters → FOLLOW-UP
   - "for covid vaccines" → MISSING metric, MISSING time → FOLLOW-UP
   - "show me by line of business" → has attributes, but MISSING metric + filters + time → FOLLOW-UP

   Why FOLLOW-UP? Missing components need to be inherited from previous.

6. **Otherwise** → NEW

**Key principle:**
- Complete questions require: metric + filters + time (with year)
- Attributes alone don't make it complete
- Missing filters = FOLLOW-UP (needs inheritance)

**IMPORTANT for REASONING:**
When writing the reasoning field, clearly state:
- If user made an explicit choice, mention it first
- What components are present in current question
- What components are missing
- What needs to be inherited from previous (be specific: "Should inherit PBM and July 2025")
- Why this decision was made

EXAMPLES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example 1: User Explicit Choice - Follow-up
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "show me the expense"
Previous: "revenue for PBM for July 2025"
→ Decision: FOLLOW_UP (user explicitly selected follow-up)
→ metric: "expense", filters: [], time: null
→ Reasoning: "User explicitly selected follow-up. Current has metric 'expense' but missing filters and time. Should inherit PBM and July 2025 from previous question."    

Example 2: User Explicit Choice - New Question
User's Choice: "new-question"
Current: "revenue for Specialty"
Previous: "revenue for PBM for Q3 2025"
→ Decision: NEW (user explicitly selected new question)
→ metric: "revenue", filters: ["Specialty"], time: null (partial)
→ Reasoning: "User explicitly selected new question. Current has metric and filters but time is incomplete. Will be treated as new independent question."

Example 3: Complete New Question (Has Filters)
User's Choice: "follow-up" (default)
Current: "revenue for PBM for Q3 2025"
→ metric: "revenue", filters: ["PBM"], time: "Q3 2025"
→ Has metric + filters + time (all present) → Decision: NEW
→ Reasoning: "Complete question with metric, filters, and time. No inheritance needed."

Example 4: Complete Question with Filters (Overrides User Choice if Complete)
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "actuals for PBM for September 2025"
→ metric: "actuals", filters: ["PBM"], time: "September 2025"
→ Has metric + filters + time (all present) → Decision: NEW
→ Reasoning: "User selected follow-up, but current question is complete with metric, filters, and time. Treating as NEW since it's self-contained."

Example 5: Has Attributes but Missing Filters (FOLLOW-UP!)
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "revenue by line of business for 2025"
Previous: "revenue for PBM for Q3 2025"
→ metric: "revenue", filters: [], attributes: ["line of business"], time: "2025"
→ Has metric + attributes + time, but MISSING filters → Decision: FOLLOW_UP
→ Reasoning: "User selected follow-up. Current has metric and attributes but missing filters. Should inherit PBM from previous question."

Example 6: Missing Filters (No Attributes)
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "compare actuals for September"
Previous: "revenue for PBM for Q3 2025"
→ metric: "actuals", filters: [], time: "September" (partial)
→ Has metric + time, but MISSING filters → Decision: FOLLOW_UP
→ Reasoning: "User selected follow-up. Current has metric and partial time but missing filters. Should inherit PBM from previous question."

Example 7: Forecast Cycle Preserved
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "actuals vs forecast 8+4 for Specialty for Q3 2025"
→ metric: "actuals vs forecast 8+4", filters: ["Specialty"], time: "Q3 2025"
→ Has metric (with cycle) + filters + time → Decision: NEW
→ Reasoning: "User selected follow-up, but question is complete with metric (including 8+4 cycle), filters, and time. Treating as NEW."

Example 8: Pronoun Reference
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "why is that high"
→ Has pronoun "that" → Decision: FOLLOW_UP
→ Reasoning: "User selected follow-up. Current has pronoun 'that' which requires context. Should inherit all components (metric, filters, time) from previous question."  

Example 9: User Command in Text
User's Choice: "follow-up"
Current: "NEW: revenue for Specialty"
→ Starts with "NEW:" → Decision: NEW (respect command)
→ Reasoning: "User text starts with 'NEW:' command, overriding UI choice. Current specifies revenue for Specialty but missing time."
