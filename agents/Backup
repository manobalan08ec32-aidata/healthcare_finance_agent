B. EXTRACTED FILTERS CHECK
   EXTRACTED FILTER VALUES are pre-verified values from the database.
   - Value found in ONE column → Validate column exists in METADATA → Use it (case-insensitive, UPPER() handles it)
   - Value found in MULTIPLE columns → Check HISTORY for column hint, if no history → follow-up asking WHICH COLUMN (not about value case)
   - Value NOT found in extracted filters → Continue to METADATA check

   ⚠️ NEVER ask about value case sensitivity - UPPER() in SQL handles all case matching
