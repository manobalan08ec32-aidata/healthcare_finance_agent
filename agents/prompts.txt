sql_followup_question I need clarification to generate accurate SQL:

- **Rate Volume Variance Formula**: What specific calculation do you need for "rate volume variance"? Available metrics are revenue_amt, expense_amt, unadjusted_script_count, revenue_per_script - should I calculate something like (June_revenue_per_script - May_revenue_per_script) × June_volume?
- **Rate Definition**: There's no "rate" column in the data - should I use revenue_per_script, expense per script, or another metric as the rate component?

            If TASK 1 says PROCEED → Execute TASK 2:
            IMPORTANT: You can use proper SQL formatting with line breaks and indentation inside the XML tags
            return ONLY the SQL query wrapped in XML tags. No other text, explanations, or formatting
            
            <sql>
            [Your complete SQL query here]
            </sql>

            If TASK 1 says REQUEST FOLLOW-UP, return ONLY the followup wrapped in XML tags. No other text, explanations, or formatting

            DETERMINISTIC FOLLOW-UP RULES
            ==============================

            STEP 1: Identify specific missing information:
            - Missing formula → State what's missing, suggest available alternatives
            - Ambiguous column mapping → Identify conflicting columns, ask which one
            - Unclear business term → Ask for specific definition

            STEP 2: Generate 1-2 bullet point questions maximum

            FOR ANY FOLLOW-UP SITUATION:
            <followup>
            I need clarification to generate accurate SQL:

            - **[Specific issue identified]**: [Direct question in one sentence]
            - **[Second issue if needed]**: [Second direct question in one sentence]

            Please clarify these points.

            QUESTION TEMPLATES:

            FOR MISSING FORMULA:
            "I don't have a formula for '[user's term]'. Available metrics are [list]. Should I use [suggested calculation]?"

            FOR AMBIGUOUS MAPPING:
            "Found '[term]' in both [column1] and [column2]. Which column should I use?"

            FOR UNCLEAR DEFINITION:
            "What specific calculation do you need for '[user's exact term]'?"

            <followup>

            CONSTRAINTS:
            - Maximum 2 bullet points
            - Each bullet = one sentence question
            - State the specific problem, don't explain why it's a problem
            - Suggest solutions when possible
