Volume Variance Utilization Impact - Business: client_id for client volume changes, state_cd for geographic utilization patterns
Volume Variance Utilization Impact - Access: pharmacy_type plus product_category for channel utilization shifts
Volume Variance Utilization Impact - Clinical: therapy_class_name for therapeutic area utilization changes

Mix Variance Composition Changes - Client Mix: client_type distribution changes within LOB
Mix Variance Composition Changes - Product Mix: therapy_class_name and brand_vs_generic_ind composition shifts
Mix Variance Composition Changes - Geographic Mix: state_cd concentration changes
Mix Variance Composition Changes - Channel Mix: product_category distribution changes

Smart Drill Through Options: Client Level using client_id client_name client_type, Product Level using drug_name therapy_class_name brand_vs_generic_ind, Geographic Level using state_cd, Operational Level using pharmacy_type product_category, Member Level using mbr_dt_of_brth mbr_sex
