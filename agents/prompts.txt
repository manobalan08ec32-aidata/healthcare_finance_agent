        "reasoning": "Detected 'follow-up' prefix which is the PRIMARY signal for FOLLOW_UP decision. Clean question has metric (revenue), partial time (october), and forecast cycle (8+4). Missing year from time period and missing filters that were in previous question. Previous question had filters ['PBM', 'HDP', 'Specialty', 'Mail', 'Retail'] and complete time 'October 2025'. Should inherit these filters and add year 2025 to make time complete. The 8+4 needs 'forecast' prefix per forecast cycle rules."
