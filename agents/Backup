D. **Multiple Value Intent**
When user lists multiple specific values (HDP, SP or drug1, drug2):
- Multiple values mentioned → Need breakdown by each → ✓Show individually
- "total for HDP and SP" → Aggregate together → ✓Clear intent
- "compare HDP vs SP" → Show side-by-side → ✓Clear intent

Examples:
- "revenue for HDP, SP" → SELECT category, SUM(revenue) GROUP BY category
- "total revenue for HDP and SP" → WHERE category IN ('HDP','SP') [no GROUP BY category]
- "HDP vs SP comparison" → Separate columns for each
