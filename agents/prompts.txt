**Decision Examples (Use these patterns):**

**Real Conversation Chain from Production:**

Ex1: Current: "new question - What is PBM revenue for Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024"
→ Prefix: "new question" → NEW | Has: metric+filters+time (complete) → Use as-is
→ Filters: ["PBM"]

Ex2: Current: "follow-up - What therapies contributed to increase" | Prev: "PBM revenue Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024"
→ Prefix: "follow-up" → FOLLOW_UP | "increase" missing metric → inherit "revenue"
→ Missing: filters (PBM), time → inherit both
→ Rewrite: "What therapies contributed to revenue increase for PBM for Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024"
→ Filters: ["PBM"]

Ex3: Current: "follow-up - what GLP-1 drugs drove the increase, include adjusted scripts" | Prev: "revenue increase for PBM Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024"
→ Prefix: "follow-up" → FOLLOW_UP | "increase" missing metric → inherit "revenue"
→ Current adds: GLP-1 | Inherits: PBM, time
→ Filters: ["GLP-1", "PBM"]

Ex4: Current: "follow-up - compare drug Wegovy decline" | Prev: "revenue increase for GLP-1 for PBM Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024"
→ Prefix: "follow-up" → FOLLOW_UP | Change: "increase" → "decline", missing metric → inherit "revenue"
→ Current: Wegovy replaces GLP-1 | Inherits: PBM, time
→ Filters: ["Wegovy", "PBM"]

Ex5: Current: "follow-up - What lines of business contributed to the decline" | Prev: "revenue decline for Wegovy for PBM Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024"
→ Prefix: "follow-up" → FOLLOW_UP | "decline" missing metric → inherit "revenue"
→ Current adds: attributes (lines of business) | Inherits: Wegovy, PBM, time
→ Filters: ["Wegovy", "PBM"]

Ex6: Current: "follow-up - What Clients in External LOB contributed to the decline" | Prev: "revenue decline for Wegovy for PBM Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024"
→ Prefix: "follow-up" → FOLLOW_UP | "decline" missing metric → inherit "revenue"
→ Current adds: attributes (Clients), filter (External LOB) | Inherits: Wegovy, PBM, time
→ Filters: ["External LOB", "Wegovy", "PBM"]

**Edge Cases:**

Ex7: Current: "validation - revenue was wrong" | Prev: any
→ Prefix: "validation" → VALIDATION

Ex8: Current: "why is that high" (no prefix) | Prev: "revenue for PBM for Q3 2025"
→ No prefix, has pronoun "that" → FOLLOW_UP (inherit all: revenue, PBM, Q3 2025)

Ex9: Current: "actuals for PBM for September" (no prefix) | Prev: "revenue by LOB for Q3 2025"
→ No prefix, auto-detect | Has metric+filters+partial time → FOLLOW_UP (add year)
