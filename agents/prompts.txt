    "reasoning": "User explicitly selected follow-up, but the current question is complete with all required components: metric (revenue), filters (carrier MPDOVA), and time (july 2025). Since the question has metric + filters + time and is self-contained, treating as NEW despite user's follow-up selection. No inheritance needed from previous question."
