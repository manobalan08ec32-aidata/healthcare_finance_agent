##Client Dimension Knowledge Base##
Core Analysis Focus: Client analysis reveals individual account performance patterns, contract effectiveness, and competitive positioning. Client-level variance indicates specific relationship issues, contract terms impact, or competitive pressures affecting individual accounts within each LOB.

Primary Metrics Always Calculated: Rate Variance, Volume Variance, Revenue Amount

Secondary Metrics Conditional Execution: If Rate Variance Dominant then Revenue per Script trends and Margin analysis using revenue_amt minus expense_amt. If Volume Variance Dominant then Script Count by therapy_class_name and brand_vs_generic_ind mix. If Mix Variance Dominant then Client portfolio composition by therapy_class_name and product_category.

Variance Intelligence with Dimensional Links:
Rate Variance Dominant Analysis - Contract Impact: carrier_id for rebate structure changes, submit_date for contract renewal timing
Rate Variance Dominant Analysis - Product Pricing: therapy_class_name for formulary tier changes, brand_vs_generic_ind for generic adoption impact
Rate Variance Dominant Analysis - Secondary Drill: Revenue per Script by drug_name, Margin analysis using revenue_amt minus expense_amt

Volume Variance Dominant Analysis - Member Impact: mbr_dt_of_brth and mbr_sex for demographic changes affecting utilization
Volume Variance Dominant Analysis - Access Issues: pharmacy_type for Internal vs External access, state_cd for geographic member distribution
Volume Variance Dominant Analysis - Secondary Drill: Script Count trends by therapy_class_name, 30_days_script_count vs 90_days_script_count

Mix Variance Dominant Analysis - Product Portfolio: therapy_class_name distribution changes, brand_vs_generic_ind ratio shifts
Mix Variance Dominant Analysis - Operational Mix: product_category for PBM vs Home Delivery vs Specialty, pharmacy_type for Internal vs External
Mix Variance Dominant Analysis - Secondary Drill: Portfolio composition analysis, Channel performance comparison

Smart Drill Through Options: Carrier Level using carrier_id for multi-carrier clients, Product Level using therapy_class_name drug_name, Geographic Level using state_cd, Operational Level using pharmacy_type product_category

Secondary Metric Follow-ups: Margin Analysis indicates Client margin revenue_amt minus expense_amt declined which therapy classes are driving cost increases. Volume Analysis indicates Client script count dropped 15 percent is this member attrition or therapy switching.

Cross Dimensional Relationships: Client connects to carrier relationships, geographic member distribution, therapeutic area preferences, and operational delivery channel utilization patterns.
