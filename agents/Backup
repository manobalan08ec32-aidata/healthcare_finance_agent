```

    A. **PHI/PII SECURITY CHECK**:
- First, examine each dataset's "PHI_PII_Columns" field (if present)
- Analyze the user's question to identify if they are requesting any PHI/PII information
- PHI/PII includes: SSN, member IDs, personal identifiers, patient names, addresses, etc.
- Check if the user's question mentions or implies access to columns listed in "PHI_PII_Columns"
- If PHI/PII columns are requested, IMMEDIATELY return phi_found status (do not proceed to other checks)

B. **METRICS & ATTRIBUTES CHECK**:
- Extract requested metrics/measures and attributes/dimensions
- Apply smart mapping with these rules:

**TIER 1 - Direct Matches**: Exact column names
**TIER 2 - Standard Healthcare Mapping**:
    * "therapies" → "therapy_class_name"
    * "scripts" → "unadjusted_scripts/adjusted_scripts"
    * "drugs" → "drug_name"
    * "clients" → "client_id/client_name"

**TIER 3 - Mathematical Operations**:
    * "variance/variances" → calculated from existing metrics over time periods
    * "growth/change" → period-over-period calculations
    * "percentage/rate" → ratio calculations

**TIER 4 - Skip Common Filter Values**:
    * Skip validation for: "external", "internal", "retail", "mail order", "commercial", "medicare", "brand", "generic"
    * These appear to be filter values, not missing attributes

**BLOCK - Creative Substitutions**:
    * Do NOT map unrelated terms (e.g., "ingredient fee" ≠ "expense")
    * Do NOT assume domain knowledge not in metadata

- Only mark as missing if NO reasonable Tier 1-3 mapping exists

**NEW - EXPLICIT ATTRIBUTE DETECTION**:
- Scan the user's question for explicit attribute keywords(examples below):
    * "carrier" → carrier_name, carrier_id
    * "drug" → drug_name, drug_id
    * "pharmacy" → pharmacy_name, pharmacy_id
    * "therapy" → therapy_class_name, therapy_id
    * "client" → client_name, client_id
    * "manufacturer" → drug_manufctr_nm, manufacturer_name
- Flag as "explicit_attribute_mentioned = true/false"
- Store mapped column names for later filter disambiguation check
- This detection is case-insensitive and looks for these keywords anywhere in the question

C. **KEYWORD & SUITABILITY ANALYSIS**:
- **KEYWORD MATCHING**: Look for domain keywords that indicate preferences:
* "claim/claims" → indicates claim_transaction dataset relevance
* "forecast/budget" → indicates actuals_vs_forecast dataset relevance
* "ledger" → indicates actuals_vs_forecast dataset relevance

- **CRITICAL: SUITABILITY VALIDATION (HARD CONSTRAINTS)**:
* **BLOCKING RULE**: If a dataset's "not_useful_for" field contains keywords/patterns that match the user's question, IMMEDIATELY EXCLUDE that dataset regardless of other factors
* **POSITIVE VALIDATION**: Check if user's question aligns with "useful_for" field patterns
* **Example Applications**:
- User asks "top 10 clients by expense" → Ledger has "not_useful_for": ["client level expense"] → EXCLUDE ledger table completely
- User asks "drug or therapy level info" → Ledger has "not_useful_for": → EXCLUDE ledger table completely
* **PRECEDENCE**: not_useful_for OVERRIDES metrics/attributes availability - even if a table has the columns, exclude it if explicitly marked as not suitable

- Verify time_grains match user needs (daily vs monthly vs quarterly)
- Note: Keywords indicate relevance but suitability constraints are MANDATORY

D. **COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS CHECK**:
- **PURPOSE**: Identify if multiple datasets together provide more complete analysis than any single dataset
- **LOOK FOR THESE PATTERNS**:
* Primary metric in one dataset + dimensional attributes in another (e.g., "ledger revenue" + "therapy breakdown")
* Different analytical perspectives on same business question (e.g., actuals view + claims view)
* One dataset provides core data, another provides breakdown/segmentation
* Cross-dataset comparison needs (e.g., budget vs actual vs claims)
* **BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS**: When question asks for metric breakdown by dimensions not available in the primary dataset

- **EVALUATION CRITERIA**:
* Single dataset with ALL metrics + attributes → SELECT IT
* No single complete dataset → SELECT MULTIPLE if complementary
* Primary metric in A + breakdown dimension in B → SELECT BOTH

**KEY EXAMPLES**:
- "top 10 drugs by revenue" → Claims table (has revenue + drug_name) NOT Ledger (missing drug_name)
- "total revenue" → Ledger table (high_level_table tie-breaker when both have revenue)
- "ledger revenue breakdown by drug" → Both tables (complementary: ledger revenue + claims drug_name)

**CLARIFICATION vs COMPLEMENTARY**:
- Ask clarification when: Same data available in multiple datasets with different contexts OR multiple columns in same table
- Select multiple when: Different but compatible data needed from each dataset for complete analysis

F. **FINAL DECISION LOGIC**:
- **STEP 1**: Check results from sections A through D
- **STEP 2**: MANDATORY Decision order:
* **FIRST**: Apply suitability constraints - eliminate datasets with "not_useful_for" matches
* **SECOND**: Validate complete coverage (metrics + attributes) on remaining datasets
* **THIRD**: Single complete dataset → SELECT IT

* **NEW - SMART FILTER DISAMBIGUATION CHECK**:
**STEP 3A**: Check if filter values exist in multiple columns
**STEP 3B**: Determine if follow-up is needed using this SIMPLIFIED logic:

1. **Check for explicit attribute mention**:
    - Was an attribute explicitly mentioned in the question? (from Section B detection)
    - Examples: "Carrier", "drug", "pharmacy", "therapy", "client", "manufacturer", "plan"

2. **Count matching columns in selected dataset**:
    - From filter metadata, identify all columns containing the filter value
    - Filter to only columns that exist in the selected dataset's attributes
    - Store as: matching_columns_count

3. **SIMPLE DECISION TREE**:
    - IF explicit_attribute_mentioned = true → NO FOLLOW-UP (trust user's specification)
    - IF explicit_attribute_mentioned = false:
        * IF matching_columns_count = 1 → NO FOLLOW-UP (obvious choice)
        * IF matching_columns_count > 1 → RETURN "needs_disambiguation"

**Examples**:
- "Carrier MPDOVA billed amount" + MPDOVA in [carrier_name, carrier_id, plan_name] → ✓ NO follow-up (user said "Carrier")
- "MPDOVA billed amount" + MPDOVA in [carrier_name] only → ✓ NO follow-up (only 1 match)
- "covid vaccine billed amount" + covid vaccine in [drug_name, pharmacy_name, therapy_class_name] → ❌ ASK which column (no explicit attribute, 3 matches)

* **FOURTH**: No single complete → SELECT MULTIPLE if complementary
* **FIFTH**: Multiple complete → Use traditional tie-breakers (keywords, high_level_table)
* **SIXTH**: Still tied → RETURN "needs_disambiguation" and ask user to choose
* **LAST**: No coverage OR unresolvable ambiguity → Report as missing items or request clarification

**HIGH LEVEL TABLE PRIORITY RULE** (ONLY APPLIES DURING TIES):
- **CRITICAL**: High-level table priority is ONLY used as a tie-breaker when multiple datasets have ALL required metrics AND attributes
- **PRIMARY RULE**: ALWAYS validate that dataset has both required metrics AND required attributes FIRST
- **HIGH LEVEL QUESTION INDICATORS**: Questions asking for summary metrics, totals, aggregates, or general overviews without specific breakdowns
- **Examples of HIGH LEVEL**: "total revenue", "overall costs", "summary metrics", "high-level view", "aggregate performance", "what is the revenue", "show me costs"     
- **Examples of NOT HIGH LEVEL**: "revenue breakdown by therapy", "costs by client", "detailed analysis", "revenue by drug category", "performance by region", "top drugs by revenue", "top clients by cost"
- **VALIDATION FIRST RULE**:
* Step 1: Check if dataset has required metrics (revenue, cost, etc.)
* Step 2: Check if dataset has required attributes/dimensions (drug_name, therapy_class_name, client_id, etc.)
* Step 3: ONLY if multiple datasets pass Steps 1 & 2, then check "high_level_table": "True" as tie-breaker
- **NEVER OVERRIDE RULE**: Never select high_level_table if it's missing required attributes, even for "high-level" questions

==============================
DECISION CRITERIA
==============================

**PHI_FOUND** IF:
- User question requests or implies access to PHI/PII columns
- Any columns mentioned in "PHI_PII_Columns" are being requested
- Must be checked FIRST before other validations

**PROCEED** (SELECT DATASET) IF:
- **STANDARD PATH**: Dataset passes suitability validation (not blocked by "not_useful_for" field) AND all requested metrics/attributes have Tier 1-3 matches AND clear selection
- Single dataset meets all requirements after suitability and coverage checks
- Complementary datasets identified for complete coverage after all validations

**MISSING_ITEMS** IF:
- Required metrics/attributes don't have Tier 1-3 matches in any dataset
- No suitable alternatives available after all validation steps

**REQUEST_FOLLOW_UP** IF:
- **PRIORITY 1 - DATASET AMBIGUITY**:
* Multiple datasets with conflicting contexts AND no clear preference from traditional validation
* ALWAYS ask user to specify which table/dataset to use FIRST

- **PRIORITY 2 - SMART FILTER COLUMN AMBIGUITY**:
* User did NOT explicitly mention an attribute (e.g., no "carrier", "drug", "pharmacy" keywords)
* AND filter value exists in 2+ columns within the selected dataset
* Example: "covid vaccine billed amount" where drug_name, pharmacy_name, therapy_class_name all have "covid vaccine"
* ALWAYS list all matching columns with sample values and ask user to specify
* NOTE: If user explicitly mentions attribute (e.g., "Carrier MPDOVA"), NO follow-up needed regardless of multiple matches
