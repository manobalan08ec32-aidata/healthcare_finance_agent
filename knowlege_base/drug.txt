Drug Dimension Knowledge Base
Core Analysis Focus: Drug analysis reveals individual medication performance patterns, utilization trends, and competitive positioning. Drug-level variance indicates formulary changes, generic substitution, clinical guideline shifts, or market access issues affecting specific medication performance.

Primary Metrics Always Calculated: Volume Variance, Script Count, Revenue Amount

Secondary Metrics Conditional Execution: If Volume Variance Dominant then Brand vs Generic ratio analysis and Script Count by geographic region. If Rate Variance Detected then Revenue per Script trends and Margin analysis using revenue_amt minus expense_amt.

Variance Intelligence with Dimensional Links:
Volume Variance Dominant Analysis - Generic Substitution: brand_vs_generic_ind for brand to generic switching patterns
Volume Variance Dominant Analysis - Geographic Patterns: state_cd for regional utilization differences
Volume Variance Dominant Analysis - Secondary Drill: Script Count trends by therapy_class_name comparison, 30_days_script_count vs 90_days_script_count

Rate Variance Analysis - Pricing Changes: Revenue per Script trends over time periods
Rate Variance Analysis - Secondary Drill: Margin analysis using revenue_amt minus expense_amt

Smart Drill Through Options: Therapy Class Level using therapy_class_name to see if issue affects entire therapeutic area, Brand Generic Analysis using brand_vs_generic_ind for substitution patterns, Geographic Analysis using state_cd for regional utilization patterns, Supply Analysis using 30_days_script_count vs 90_days_script_count for supply duration patterns

Secondary Metric Follow-ups: Volume Analysis indicates Drug script count declined 25 percent is this generic substitution or therapeutic area decline. Geographic Analysis indicates Drug performance varies by region are there state-specific access barriers.

Cross Dimensional Relationships: Drug connects to therapeutic class competition patterns, brand generic substitution dynamics, geographic utilization differences, and supply duration preferences based on medication characteristics.
