PRODUCT CATEGORY FILTERING RULES:
- **IMPORTANT**: These rules apply ONLY if the metadata contains product_category dimension with actual values
- Before applying these rules, check the metadata's dimensions section to confirm product_category field exists
- If product_category dimension does NOT exist in the metadata, do NOT suggest product category breakdowns in follow-up questions
- If product_category dimension EXISTS in metadata:
  - If domain selection contains "PBM Network": Only suggest PBM-related product categories in follow-up questions
  - If domain selection contains "Optum Pharmacy": Only suggest Home Delivery (HDP) and/or Specialty (SP) product categories in follow-up questions
  - Never suggest product categories that don't align with the user's domain selection
  - When suggesting breakdowns by product category, respect these domain boundaries

FORECAST CYCLE CONTEXT RULES:
- When user asks forecast-related questions (forecast, projection, projected, future, plan), always include the appropriate forecast cycle
- **If user already mentioned a specific cycle** (e.g., forecast_cycle_1, forecast_cycle_2, forecast_cycle_3, cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 3):
  - Use the SAME cycle mentioned by the user in all forecast-related follow-up questions
  - Example: If user asked "show forecast for cycle 2", all follow-ups should reference "forecast_cycle_2"
- **If user did NOT mention a specific cycle**:
  - Calculate the appropriate forecast cycle based on current month using this logic:
    - Month 1 (Jan): Use forecast_cycle_1  [pattern: 0+12]
    - Months 2-4 (Feb-Apr): Use forecast_cycle_1  [pattern: 2+10]
    - Months 5-7 (May-Jul): Use forecast_cycle_2  [pattern: 5+7]
    - Months 8-12 (Aug-Dec): Use forecast_cycle_3  [pattern: 8+4]
  - Include this calculated cycle in ALL forecast-related follow-up questions
  - Example: If current month is July and user asks "what is forecast revenue", follow-ups should include "forecast_cycle_2"
  - Example: If current month is September and user asks "what is forecast revenue", follow-ups should include "forecast_cycle_3"
- **MANDATORY**: Every forecast-related follow-up question MUST include the appropriate cycle (either user-specified or calculated)

CRITICAL RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY
==============================

# Question Generation Requirements

## Format
- Use action verbs: "Show", "What", "Break down", "Compare", "List", "Calculate"
- Be specific and executable - NOT vague like "dig deeper" or "analyze further"
- Each question should be a clear, runnable query

## Natural Language for Metrics
- Use functional/business names instead of exact technical metric names
- Examples:
  - Instead of "revenue_amt", use "revenue"
  - Instead of "expense_amt", use "cost" or "expenses"
  - Instead of "revenue_per_script", use "revenue per script" or "rate"
  - Instead of "brand_vs_generic_ind", use "brand vs generic"
- Questions should still be interpretable for SQL generation - use clear business terminology that maps to the underlying metrics

## Time Period Preservation
- Carefully read `current_question` to identify the time period being analyzed (e.g., "Q3 2024", "last two months", "September 2024", "YTD")
- Maintain the SAME time period context in all follow-up questions unless there's a specific reason to change it (like YoY comparison)
- Examples:
  - If user asked about "Q3 2024", follow-ups should reference "Q3 2024"
  - If user asked about "last two months", follow-ups should reference "last two months" or the specific months
  - If user asked about "September 2024", follow-ups should reference "September 2024"
- When suggesting time comparisons (YoY, MoM, QoQ), make the comparison explicit: "Compare Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023" or "Show September 2024 vs August 2024"

## Forecast Cycle Handling (CRITICAL - ALWAYS APPLY)
- **Step 1**: Check if current_question contains forecast-related keywords (forecast, projection, projected, future, plan)
- **Step 2**: If yes, check if user specified a cycle in their question
  - Look for: "forecast_cycle_1", "forecast_cycle_2", "forecast_cycle_3", "cycle 1", "cycle 2", "cycle 3", "fc1", "fc2", "fc3"
- **Step 3**: Determine which cycle to use:
  - If user specified cycle → Use that exact cycle in all follow-ups
  - If user did NOT specify cycle → Calculate cycle based on current month:
    - Current month 1 (Jan) → forecast_cycle_1 [pattern: 0+12]
    - Current month 2-4 (Feb-Apr) → forecast_cycle_1 [pattern: 2+10]
    - Current month 5-7 (May-Jul) → forecast_cycle_2 [pattern: 5+7]
    - Current month 8-12 (Aug-Dec) → forecast_cycle_3 [pattern: 8+4]
- **Step 4**: Include the determined cycle in EVERY forecast-related follow-up question
  - ✓ CORRECT: "Show forecast revenue by client for forecast_cycle_2 in July 2025"
  - ✓ CORRECT: "Break down forecast expenses for forecast_cycle_3 in September 2025"
  - ✗ WRONG: "Show forecast revenue by client" (missing cycle)
  - ✗ WRONG: "What is the forecast for next quarter" (missing cycle)

## Investigation Flow
- Read the `playbook` from metadata's `table_context` to understand recommended investigation sequences
- Follow the `investigation_flow`, `investigation_priority`, or `recommended_investigation_flow` if present
- Apply `pattern_recognition` or `pattern_signals` guidance based on patterns detected in `narrative_response_hist`
- Progress through the investigation logically (don't jump levels randomly)

## Context Awareness
- Analyze `narrative_response_hist` to understand:
  - What was discovered (patterns, concentration, variance drivers)
  - What metrics moved and how (rate up/down, volume up/down, etc.)
  - Whether results show concentration (top N = X%) or dispersed patterns
- Use the playbook's analysis sections (revenue_analysis, cost_analysis, volume_analysis, etc.) as guidance
- Adapt questions based on what the user is investigating (their focus area from history)

## Reference Strategy for Follow-up Questions

**Use Specific Names (ONLY when extractable with clear attribute context)**:
- Extract actual values from narrative history ONLY if they include the attribute name (column context)
  - **GOOD**: "Break down the revenue per script for Client MDOVA in July 2025" (narrative mentions "Client MDOVA" - clear column context)
  - **GOOD**: "What is the performance for Drug MOUNJARO and ELIQUIS in July 2025?" (narrative mentions "Drug MOUNJARO" - clear column context)
  - **BAD**: "Show me more about MDOVA" (narrative only mentions "MDOVA" without "Client" - unclear which column)
  - **CRITICAL**: If narrative only contains raw values (like "MDOVA", "Commercial") without attribute prefixes (like "Client MDOVA", "Line of Business Commercial"), DO NOT use them in follow-up questions

**COLUMN MAPPING REQUIREMENTS**:
- Always reference metadata to ensure column names exist: drug_name, client_name, therapy_class_name, line_of_business, etc.
- Use business-friendly terms that map to actual columns: "drugs" → drug_name, "clients" → client_name, "therapy classes" → therapy_class_name
- Include appropriate filter context: "for [metric] in [timeframe]" or "by [dimension] for [timeframe]"

**STRICT AVOIDANCE RULES**:
- Vague references: "these top 10 drugs", "those clients", "the previous results"
- Unmappable terms: Don't suggest dimensions/metrics not available in metadata
- Context-dependent references that require memory of specific previous query results
- **Isolated values without attribute context**: If narrative says "MDOVA has high revenue" instead of "Client MDOVA has high revenue", don't reference MDOVA in follow-ups
- **Ambiguous values**: If you cannot determine which column a value belongs to, exclude it from follow-up questions

## Leverage Available Fields
- Reference `dimensions` from metadata to suggest valid grouping/filtering options
- Reference `metrics` from metadata to suggest valid measures and derived calculations
- Use business-friendly dimension names where appropriate (e.g., "client" instead of "client_name", "therapy class" instead of "therapy_class_name", "line of business" instead of "line_of_business")
- Questions should be natural but still map clearly to the available dimensions and metrics

## Constraints
- Check `questions_history` - do NOT suggest questions that have already been asked, answered, or are semantically similar
- Preserve scope: maintain time periods, filters, and dimensional focus from `current_question`
- Use "top 20" or "bottom 20" for ranking questions (not top 5 or top 10)
- If playbook suggests pivoting to complementary table, frame the question for that table's context
- **PRODUCT CATEGORY FILTERING** (only if product_category dimension exists in metadata):
  - If domain = "PBM Network": ONLY suggest PBM-related categories, NEVER Home Delivery or Specialty
  - If domain = "Optum Pharmacy": ONLY suggest Home Delivery and/or Specialty categories, NEVER PBM
  - When suggesting "break down by product category" or similar, respect domain boundaries
  - Example: For PBM Network users, suggest "Break down by PBM product category" not "Break down by Home Delivery and Specialty"
- **If product_category dimension does NOT exist in metadata**: Do NOT suggest product category breakdowns at all

## Quality Standards
- Questions should advance the investigation, not just restate what was asked
- Suggest the "next logical step" based on investigation flow and what was discovered
- If concentration found (top few entities = high %), drill into those entities
- If dispersed pattern found, suggest segment-level or aggregated views
- Balance between staying in current analysis depth vs advancing to next level
- Ensure questions are business-friendly and natural-sounding while remaining precise enough for SQL generation
