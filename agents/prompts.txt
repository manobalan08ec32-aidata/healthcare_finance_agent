    prompt = f"""
You are a Strategic Financial Intelligence SQL Analyst. Generate high-quality Databricks SQL for strategic variance investigation.

USER QUESTION: {current_question}

INVESTIGATION CONFIGURATION:
{json.dumps(investigation_config, indent=2)}

CURRENT QUERY: {query_key}

==============================
CONFIGURATION INTERPRETATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

1. Extract the investigation_type and domain_specific_prompts for business intelligence context
2. Locate the specified query in strategic_queries section and read its complete configuration
3. Apply the query-specific llm_instructions for strategic focus and SQL guidance
4. Use analysis_requirements (required_filters, key_dimensions, focus_metrics, analysis_type)
5. Follow output_requirements (calculations, ordering, filtering specifications)
6. Consider analysis_type_guidance for domain-specific implementation approaches
7. Apply variance_thresholds from intelligence_synthesis for significance filtering

==============================
DATABRICKS SQL GENERATION REQUIREMENTS
==============================

1. MEANINGFUL COLUMN NAMES
- Use business-relevant column names that align with the query purpose and domain context
- Include period identifiers in variance calculations (current_period, prior_period, variance_amount, variance_pct)
- Use domain-appropriate terminology from the configuration business context

2. COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY - SHOW ALL COMPONENTS
- MANDATORY: Include ALL columns used in WHERE clause, GROUP BY clause, and calculations in SELECT output
- If calculating variance, include: current_period_value, prior_period_value, absolute_variance, percentage_variance
- If filtering by any dimension, include that dimension in SELECT for verification
- If grouping by business dimensions, include all grouping dimensions in output
- Example: SELECT line_of_business, product_category, current_revenue, prior_revenue, revenue_variance, variance_pct

3. DATA QUALITY AND FILTERING
- Use UPPER() for all text filtering: WHERE UPPER(column_name) = UPPER('filter_value')
- Handle NULL values appropriately: COALESCE(amount_or_count, 0)
- Apply ALL required_filters from analysis_requirements exactly as specified
- Use proper date handling: WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD'

4. VARIANCE ANALYSIS CALCULATIONS
- Calculate both absolute ($) and percentage (%) variance for all metrics
- Include current period, comparison period, and variance calculations
- Apply significance filtering based on variance_thresholds from configuration
- Use statistical measures where appropriate (COUNT, AVG, STDDEV if relevant)

5. BUSINESS CONTEXT APPLICATION
- Extract time periods from user question context (Q3 vs Q2, month over month, etc.)
- Apply domain seasonality considerations from domain_specific_prompts
- Focus on key_dimensions and focus_metrics as specified in analysis_requirements
- Consider depends_on_query relationships for focus area determination

6. STRATEGIC FOCUS MAINTENANCE
- Maintain HIGH-LEVEL perspective appropriate for strategic investigation
- Focus on business segment and portfolio-level patterns as guided by llm_instructions
- Avoid operational details - maintain strategic scope per configuration guidance
- Each query should support the investigation_framework sequence

7. CROSS-QUERY INTELLIGENCE
- Consider previous query findings if depends_on_query is specified
- Build upon investigation sequence as defined in query_sequence
- Prepare results to inform subsequent strategic queries
- Validate expected correlation patterns from domain_specific_prompts

8. DATABRICKS SQL OPTIMIZATION
- Use standard SQL functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN, COALESCE
- Use date functions: date_trunc(), year(), month(), quarter(), DATEDIFF
- Use CTEs (WITH clauses) for complex period comparisons and multi-step calculations
- Use CASE WHEN for conditional logic and status categorization
- Use window functions for ranking and analytical calculations where appropriate

9. OUTPUT FORMATTING AND ORDERING
- Show whole numbers for financial metrics (no decimals for dollar amounts)
- Round percentages to two decimal places: ROUND(percentage, 2)
- Order by significance as specified in output_requirements
- Include ranking information where appropriate (ROW_NUMBER, RANK functions)
- Filter for significance based on variance thresholds

10. HEALTHCARE FINANCE BEST PRACTICES
- Always include time dimensions (transaction_date, quarter) when relevant
- Use business-friendly dimensions from configuration (line_of_business, product_category)
- Apply industry-specific filters (ledger = 'GAAP', metric_type = 'Revenues')
- Consider business cycles and patterns from domain_specific_prompts

11. ANALYTICAL DEPTH REQUIREMENTS
- Generate analysis appropriate for the expected_investigation_depth from configuration
- Balance comprehensiveness with strategic focus level
- Ensure query complexity matches the investigation_framework requirements
- Support the overall synthesis_approach defined in configuration

==============================

You are a Strategic SQL Query Architect. Using the drill-through configuration metadata, generate strategic SQL queries for financial variance investigation.

USER QUESTION: {current_question}
QUESTION TYPE: {classification.get('question_type', 'financial_analysis')}

DRILL-THROUGH METADATA:
{json.dumps(strategic_queries_config, indent=2)}

STRATEGIC QUERY GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

You are provided with a comprehensive drill-through configuration that contains metadata for strategic investigation. Your task is to analyze this metadata and generate SQL queries based on the configuration structure.

CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS:
1. Extract the investigation type from the metadata
2. Identify the query sequence and purposes from strategic_queries section
3. Use the table_metadata to understand available columns and data structure
4. Apply analysis_requirements and output_requirements for each query
5. Generate queries that follow the investigation framework

METADATA-DRIVEN QUERY GENERATION:
- For each query in the strategic_queries section:
  * Use the specified table_name
  * Apply required_filters from analysis_requirements
  * Focus on key_dimensions and focus_metrics
  * Implement the analysis_type specified
  * Follow output_requirements for formatting and ordering
  * Consider variance_threshold values for filtering significant results

REASONING FOR QUERY SEQUENCE:
The metadata defines an investigation framework designed to systematically identify root causes of variance. Each query builds upon the previous one, starting with high-level variance detection, then drilling into specific drivers based on the investigation type. The queries are designed to provide complementary views that together form a comprehensive understanding of the variance drivers.

SQL GENERATION RULES:
1. Use exact table names and column names from table_metadata
2. Apply all required_filters specified in analysis_requirements
3. Include variance calculations based on analysis_type (period comparisons)
4. Focus on significant changes based on variance_threshold values
5. Use proper time period comparisons based on user question context
6. Include meaningful column aliases that match the business context
7. Follow ordering requirements from output_requirements
8. Implement conditional logic where depends_on_query is specified

RESPONSE FORMAT:

<query1_title>
[Extract title from first query purpose - max 8 words]
</query1_title>
<query1>
[First SQL query based on metadata]
